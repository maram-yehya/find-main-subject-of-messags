Rice (oryza sativa) is the seed of a cereal grass.
 It's one of the most important dietary carbohydrates in the world,
  with over half the global population depending on it. Typically boiled or steamed, 
  rice can also be ground into a gluten-free flour. It's a central component of many
   cuisines including those of India, China and Southeast Asia.
There are many types of rice, but broadly speaking they are categorised by their shape 
(long or short grain) and colour â€“ white or brown. White rice has had the fibre-rich outer
 bran of the grain removed along-with the nutrient-rich germ. As a result, it has a longer 
 shelf life, is quick to cook but has a bland, neutral flavour; nutritionally it has less 
 fibre and protein than the wholegrain equivalent. 
Brown rice, on the other hand, contains both the bran and germ, making it nutrient- and fibre-rich and retains a nutty flavour.
